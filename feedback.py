# The project - find a volunteer based on the criteria
# 
# The project works. I like the logic, your code is clean and I see you used OOP, modules and DB. And the usage of env is correct.
# That is very good that you practiced decorators. Just a note that you also could use @staticmethod for those functions that do not need a self, like:
# def select(name):

# The only thing you forgot to do with your db is create tables through the code before doing all other actions :) 
# And you could make a simple GUI with tkinter to make it more visual. But the idea and project itself are very very good.

# Python OOP:10/10
# Modules: 10/10
# Database:8/10
